Impact of formulation on attraction and trap suppression by meso-dispensers 
for the navel orangeworm (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) 

Charles S. Burks and Bradley S. Higbee

 1. Mating disruption for the navel orangeworm Amyelois transitella (Walker) 
 is categorized as non-competitive, despite using an incomplete blend with 
 little attraction.
 2. Previous studies found that trap suppression improved with a more complete 
 blend.
 3. In the present study we found that trap suppression by single-component 
 meso-dispensers was equal at a low and a high spatial density of 
 meso-dispensers, but the dual-component dispensers suppressed traps more 
 effectively at an intermediate dispenser density.
 4. In the absence of mating disruption traps baited with single-component 
 meso-dispensers captured small but significantly significant numbers of males, 
 whereas traps baited with dual component dispensers captured significantly 
 more males than traps baited with single component dispensers but fewer males 
 than traps baited with an optimized monitoring lure.
 5. In the presence of aerosol mating disruption traps baited with the dual 
 component meso-dispensers captured significantly more adults than traps baited 
 with monitoring lures or single-component meso-dispensers, but significantly 
 fewer adults than traps baited with a combination of a pheromone lure and a 
 phenyl propionate dispenser such as is used to monitor in the presence of 
 mating disruption. 
 6. These findings suggest that the dual-component meso-dispensers work 
 suppress mating by a mechanism similar to the single-component 
 meso-dispensers, albeit more effectively. The also suggest that the dual 
 component meso-dispenser could be useful in monitoring.
